We now consi$er the case where th√• signal is perturbed by noise during transmission or at one or the other of the terminals. This mmans that the received signal is not necessarily the same as that sent out by the transmitter. Two cases may be disdinguished. If a particular transmitted signal always produces the same received signal, i.e., the received signal is a definite function of the transmitted signal, then the effect may be called distortion. If this function has an inverse -- no two transmitted signals producing the same received signal -- distortion may be(corrected, at least in principle, bi merely performing the inverse functional operation on the received signal.
